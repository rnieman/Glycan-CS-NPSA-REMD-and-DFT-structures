# Glycan-CS-NPSA-REMD-and-DFT-structures
REMD- and DFT-derived glycan structures for the determination of single-point energies and CS-NPSA values and distributions. In each of the two zip files, there are three classes of glcyan structures investigated: linear, biantennary, and triantennary. PBE files are provided for the REMD structures and xyz files are provided for the DFT structures.
