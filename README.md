# Glycan-CS-NPSA-REMD-and-DFT-structures
REMD- and DFT-derived glycan structures for the determination of single-point energies and CS-NPSA values and distributions. In each of the two zip files, there are three classes of glcyan structures investigated: linear, biantennary, and triantennary. PBE files are provided for the REMD structures and xyz files are provided for the DFT structures.

Additionally, example input files are provided for GROMACS and TURBOMOLE calculations of the linear GLC09 glycan. These are typical of all the glycan calculation inputs.
